JPacman is developed in Java and runs as a Java application.

In the application, the player is able to:
a. start the game
b. move around a rectangular board
c. die if the player is touched by a ghost after the game has started
d. win by eating all the food
e. suspend, restart or exit the game.

Short Description of the Project by Joanna Leung (g15-jl)

When we run JPacman as a Java application, a window pops up with the game. 
The player can control the movement of the pacman with arrow keys once the player
presses the start button. If the player collides with a ghost in the same cell, 
the player loses the game. If the player is able to collect all the food on 
the map, then the player wins the game. The player can pause the game by 
pressing stop any time and can exit the game by pressing the exit button.
